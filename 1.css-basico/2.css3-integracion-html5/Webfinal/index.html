            Spread across three pretty white town houses in peaceful Leinster
            Square, we are in the heart of London’s cosmopolitan Notting Hill
            neighbourhood, a short walk from the Portobello Road Market and
            within easy reach of various tourist hotspots including Hyde Park,
            Oxford Street and Westfield Shopping Centre. Just a few steps from
            us is the fashionable Westbourne Grove where the annual Notting Hill
            Carnival passes through. </p>

            Beyond the Victorian facade and entrance
            pillars are stylish individually-designed bedrooms and suites in
            palettes of cream, brown, red and black with an Oriental flavour
            alongside trendy minimal furnishings, high-tech entertainment units
            and stunning marble, limestone and slate bathrooms. This is style on
            a budget: high-end finishes and use of lavish fabrics and materials
            such as silk, velvet and the finest cotton create a lavish and
            comfortable setting. Rooms are functional too with Free WiFi, Smart
            Flatscreen TV, in-room Safe, Tea and Coffee Making Facilities;
            Bathrooms have walk-in power showers and designer toiletries. If
            staying with friends or the children, Triple and Family Rooms are
            ideal while the Honeymoon Suite is the pinnacle of City romance
            spots with its Jacuzzi bath, floor-to-ceiling windows and private
            terrace. Head on down to the lower ground floor for a freshly
            prepared continental breakfast each morning or weather permitting,
            outside on the communal terrace. Or relax in our designated guest
            lounge area on the ground floor where you can read a newspaper,
            catch up with emails or plan your next move. Whatever that is you
            will find our location handy, being just 7 minutes walk from Notting
            Hill Underground Station, Bayswater Tube Station and Queensway Tube
            Station.
